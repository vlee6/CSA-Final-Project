# My final project for AP CSA

## Click this link to play it: https://vlee6.github.io/CSA-Final-Project/

### Controls:
WASD to move
R for basic attacks (punches, 100 ton weight)
T for special attacks (Toyota Corolla, finger gun, baseball bat)

Currently, there’s only one player with real animations (the other one is a sandbag). All of the controls, attack mechanics, and animations are complete for player two, but I don’t have the time to implement them as of now.
